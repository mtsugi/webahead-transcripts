Transcripts for The Web Ahead
=============================

For over a year, we've been using this GitHub repo as a place to organize and publish transcripts of [The Web Ahead podcast](http://thewebahead.net). Now that the new website has been launched, all of the transcripts live there, in Drupal. The old Jekyll-based website has been closed down. And I pulled all the transcripts from this repo so that we don't have to maintain two copies. Updated, corrected versions are at [thewebahead.net](http://thewebahead.net).

Meanwhile, a crew of volunteers is still working hard to make transcripts of the show possible. Thank you to everyone who's helping. Let's keep using the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jensimmons/webahead-transcripts/issues) to coordinate our efforts. 

If you would like to help, updated directions on how can be found at [thewebahead.net/help/transcripts](http://thewebahead.net/help/transcripts).
