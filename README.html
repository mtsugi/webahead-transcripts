<h1>Transcripts for The Web Ahead</h1>

<p>For over a year, we&rsquo;ve been using this GitHub repo as a place to organize and publish transcripts of <a href="http://thewebahead.net">The Web Ahead podcast</a>. Now that the new website has been launched, all of the transcripts live there, in Drupal. The old Jekyll-based website has been closed down. And I pulled all the transcripts from this repo so that we don&rsquo;t have to maintain two copies. Updated, corrected versions are at <a href="http://thewebahead.net">thewebahead.net</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a crew of volunteers is still working hard to make transcripts of the show possible. Thank you to everyone who&rsquo;s helping. Let&rsquo;s keep using the <a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/webahead-transcripts/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> to coordinate our efforts.</p>

<p>If you would like to help, updated directions on how can be found at <a href="http://thewebahead.net/help/transcripts">thewebahead.net/help/transcripts</a>.</p>
