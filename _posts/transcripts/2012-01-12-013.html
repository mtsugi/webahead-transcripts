<p>This is the Web Ahead. I'm Jen Simmons. A weekly conversation about changing technologies and the future of the
web. Episode 13. We want to say thanks to today's sponsors Rackspace and Harvest. Bandwidth for this episode
was provided by Vidmeup, a free service that allows you to create your own video site. Your videos. Your

<p>Today's guest, special guest is Dan Benjamin. Dan Benjamin, the producer of the whole 5by5 network. Author of <a
href="http://hivelogic.com">hivelogic.com</a> and a whole bunch of other things. Hi Dan.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Dan Benjamin</dt>
<dd>Hey Jen.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I thought you were going to interrupt me, during, we had a whole bit</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I was gonna but I like you. You were doing so well. I mean who am I to interrupt you?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, just, you know</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>It sounded great.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Thanks. Yeah, you know it's next week is the one year from when I was first on The Big Web Show with Jeffrey
Zeldman and met you.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Oh right. Yeah, that's right, Jeffrey found you in some restaurant or something,
and said she'd be really good on the show, so we brought you on the show and the next thing you know we do this
Daily Edition for a while. How long did we do that for?
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I think it was 37 shows that I was on. So, two months, I think.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah but we did them every, that's the thing we did them five days a week pretty much</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, every day. And I missed doing that. When you moved, we stopped recording that show,
and I missed it like crazy, it's weird.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>And all you did the whole time all along was say how cramped it was in your schedule to try and fit it in</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>How much I hated it, how I really wanted to stop doing it.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>And then I took it away, and you're like, I didn't say take it away. I just wanted to complain. But that's
not actually true, you were always a great sport about rearranging your entire schedule around when it was
convenient for me to record so I appreciate that.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It was fun, it was really fun to do and then I wanted to do, I really wanted to do this show. I wanted to do
this show even before you invited me to do Daily Edition. And then later, you said well "What do you want to do?"
and I was like "I want to do this show" and you were like "Ok."
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Do you want to air some of the name ideas that you had for it, if you still have those handy. Because you had
some neat names for it, "The Web Ahead" was just the one that I think stood out the most.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Where are those? I don't know if I have them.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Wasn't it the one like, I think it was like, "Grinchy Interviews" or something.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Oh, ah right, yeah.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I can't remember, I don't have the list in front of me.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah. So it's funny to me that there might be people who don't know who you are, who are listening.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I would love that. That would be fantastic if they don't.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>No new people</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>We got to get the new ones in.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Well this show is about the web, right, it's about like stuff on the web, and new stuff,
stuff that's happening now, stuff that might happen in the future. So I was thinking what do we want to talk
about today? With Dan Benjamin. I think we should talk about education. I think we should talk about how is that
people learn new stuff as everything on the web changes. How is it that people learn how to do web design,
web development, making web sites in the first place. And then how is that people keep up with it as everything
changes, and some people like to, and want to, and are good at keeping up with the very, very latest, and a lot of
people aren't. They're not really, they don't need to have the very latest, but they still need to keep up some
what, as at some point really old technology is just a really bad idea, and you can't be using image slicing and
you know table layouts and techniques from 1996 on today's web. So, what do you think about that? What do you
think about how it is that people keep up and learn and figure out how they should be doing this kind of stuff?
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah I think it's a really interesting kind of question or way to think about it because if you were to go
around and talk to people in all the different industries regardless of what it is, you know,
somebody who does automobile manufacturing. Somebody who teaches chemistry. It doesn't matter,
if you were to go and ask them, you know. Medicine is another good example. Dentistry. If you were to go and ask
them, "Oh, do you feel like your industry is changing?", "Oh yeah it changes, it's so hard to keep up. There's
so many new things coming out all the time." So I think, while you were asking me the question,
I was thinking well I think the web as far as web development and design,
it changes faster than other industries, but I'm probably not qualified to make that statement,
because I'm not in the other industries, but, it really does seem like that's the case,
that things change and sort of sweep across the industry of web development and design. It seems like they move.
When a change happens, it seems like it happens very, very quickly across the board. I'll actually pick on
dentistry for example. I used to go to a dentist back in Florida. They actually have dentists in Florida,
that was surprising. Because it's just a beach. You have the dentist guy practising there on the beach. The one
dentist I went to, he was an older guy, and he'd basically been practising the same kind of dentistry,
with essentially, really the same tools and equipment that he might have had 10 or 15 years early. And maybe they
were using a different kind of numbing agent because over the years they did tests and found that it was better or
something. Maybe they switched from the metal fillings to the white ones, but those kind of changes,
it's not like, well there's a dentist in Newark, New Jersey, who started using this new kind of filling,
and as soon as everybody found out, within a month everybody was trying it out. That does seem to me like what happens
on the web when there's a new technique that comes out, very quickly people start to see it and they start to
adapt and change and integrate it into the way that they work. Whether this is a code thing, or, you know,
as a software developer and a web developer for many years, I think that happens more in the microcosm of web
application or web development and design very quickly. So an example of that would be like,
a new style of pagination comes out in the Rails community, and within a few weeks "We're using will_paginate now
of course!". And a new way to upload a file and perform an operation on it, "Oh I can't believe you're using
attachment_fu, paperclip is sooo much better. It's been out like five days, how can you have not switched all of
your apps to it?". But that really is the mentality. So the idea of keeping up, that for me is as a,
maybe an ex, because in a past life I used to do a lot more development. That was always,
I was one of those people that I liked the benefits that you would get from keeping up-to-date and I knew I had
to do it. But I always had that feeling, as soon as I was done building something,
that it was almost immediately obsolete, or the code within it was, it felt so dated to me.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Mmm</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So how do you keep up Jen, how do you do it?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I think for a long time, we all, it was about blogging. It was about you had a little bookmark folder,
or even before bookmark folders, you just had a bunch of things bookmarked that you could go to every morning and
read the new blog posts from these people, or when RSS showed up, it was like "Oh,
well that's what we're going to use RSS for, make that faster". I'm going to read these dozen blogs every single
day and find out what's new, and it seems like that's dropped off in a way, like the prominence of blogs,
as the way to learn all the new stuff. I think because the advertisement got so obnoxious,
and blogs became less about teaching each other great stuff, and more about, many blogs,
not all of them of course, but some, more about, you know getting a catchy headline and trying to get as many
clicks as possible, and the comments went from feeling like you're in a small community of cool people to feeling
like you're in this giant mess of angry jackals or something.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Strangers that you don't know. I don't know. Somehow the blogs as the centre of everything kind of eroded.
And there's still some great, great, great blogs and there's still some resources that we all go to over our
sites, that we go to over and over again, but, it may also be because there just seemed to have been,
I don't know, at one point it seemed like there was fifty of them, and you just kept an eye on those fifty. And
now it feels like there's a hundred thousand of them, and how could you ever keep up with a hundred thousand? And
the one's that you read are not the same ones as your friends read, or the people you work with read. And then
Twitter. I think Twitter totally took over as you don't need to keep an eye on these fifty blogs everyday because
you can just rely on Twitter to click to articles that are good or things that are good.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>To tell you what to do.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, and tell you what to read, or maybe it's a whole bunch of different things. I was thinking about this a
lot this week because you know I work sometimes as a developer, sometimes as a designer,
sometimes as a consultant and a teacher/trainer, and when I get a chance to work as a developer and I'm working
with new teams, it's like new people, all new people, all new skillsets, all new you know. And a couple
different times on different projects recently, different clients, I've run in to people who they're smart,
and they're willing and they're bright and they're interested in being up-to-date,
but they literally are using techniques out of 1998, 1999, 2001, and it's a little shocking, like,
you're too young to have learned this in 1998. And you're too bright to have kept doing this out of habit. Where
did you learn this? Did you go to college, and you took a web design class in college,
and your teacher taught you everything completely wrong in 2007? Or, why, how is it that you've missed we don't
use tables for layouts any more, like where have you been? And it made me start thinking, what is it,
what resources is it that people need? What is it that would help developers keep up without it being
overwhelming? That's a big reason I wanted to do this show, that's what this show is about. But also this show is
about big. I think an audio podcast is not the place to learn CSS for layout code,
and we could sit here and go well you know you should put "position colon absolute semi-colon". You know, no, no.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right, it doesn't work as well if you just read CSS over the air.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right. It would be really boring for most people.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Unless they were really trying to follow along. But then if you say like colon instead of semi-colon,
then you'd have to say backspace. That'd be awkward.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right, yeah, really awkward.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>You drink a lot during the show.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>You know I do. When I present live I usually go through at least a whole bottle really fast.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Do you?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, I dunno, sometimes I get nervous and I have to chug the water somehow.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Like dry mouth?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah so I don't know. You had a blog for a long, long, long time. Talk about that a little. Hivelogic,
and what was successful about that? You were teaching developers how to do good development,
and then you kind of don't do it any more.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah I guess. The first post, Hivelogic, the very first post. Well, before that,
I had attempted to do a little news site, and so I started the news site in like '99,
and from '99 to sometime in 2000, I had a little site that was called dansdailynews.com,
which I don't believe exists any more, and I'm really hopeful that it's gone from the Internet. I think that it's
old enough, that not, that it's not totally saved, because it was the most inane,
stupid crap ever. And then I thought, you know, I wanted to get more serious about things,
I wanted to write more about the stuff I was doing, whether it was design, or development,
or just articles about things that were interesting to me, and sometime in early 2001 I think is. I mean I was
doing things with it in 2000, but that, it's gone, I don't know what happened to it or where it is. So I just I
started to get in the groove of writing frequently, almost daily, multiple times a day back in 2000,
2001 time period, and you know a lot of it, if you read it now especially, the earlier stuff,
it was very specific to things that were going on back then. So it's kind of interesting to go back and read an
article that I wrote about things that they seem so outdated right now. But the articles that I wrote or the
pieces that I wrote that were more personal, or not about the technology, those I think are still kind of
interesting to read. What I think I didn't like. Well you mention teaching people how to do things. That's kind
of the direction that I took Hivelogic later. I thought, you know, instead of just talking about some random
topic, or something personal, or some software I found that was neat. What if I put down,
'cos I just spent the last three and a half hours trying to get MySQL to compile on this ancient version of Mac
OS X, which was current at the time, and, you know, I couldn't find any good information on how to do this
online, so you know I'm just going to write this down as a tutorial, you know. I'm just going to write down
everything that I learned in this process and how to do it, step-by-step, and I'll put that out there. So,
it quickly, I realised those articles became very valuable resources to people,
so whenever a new version of whatever the software was, MySQL or Rails or Ruby or whatever it was,
would come out, I'd write a little tutorial, and those things were insanely popular. I mean really,
really popular. So I did that for a while and you know then the infrastructure sort of caught up, so that now,
to install MySQL, you can use something like homebrew on the Mac, and you can type "brew install mysql" and it
just works and people have asked me "Why don't you update your old tutorials?" and I say "You know I wrote those
at a time when they're really...building things yourself was the best way for a geek to get that kind of software
installed.". And now, they're people much smarter than me, writing software, and a framework,
and an infrastructure to make it just easier for people who don't want to wade through this,
and cut and paste fifty commands and everything else. Just do it.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I still think it's a good way to learn though. Well, maybe, you know, you don't need to paste fifty commands
to get MySQL installed. But there's definitely other stuff that you need to, you know, it's more complicated,
maybe or higher up in the stack, but there's, you know, it feels like doing, and sitting there and fussing your way
through it, and you look for a tutorial but you couldn't find a good one, and so you, or you found three,
four different tutorials and they all contradicted each other, and you know, you started using one of them,
and you realise it's out-of-date, and you figured out what's the new thing. And then yeah, right,
pushing to the point where you're able to write up something new and put it on your own website somewhere is a
great way to learn.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah. So, I don't know. I'll tell you what. Long story, short, why did I stop doing it? I stopped doing it
because the infrastructure caught up. I stopped doing it because, it, you know, writing,
was something I still enjoy a lot, but with things like Twitter and other social networks and things like that,
and I'll tell you what else. Look at a site like Daring Fireball. This is a very focused site that John's been
doing almost as long as I, almost as early back as I'd started Hivelogic. I mean they started within a year of
each other. Hivelogic never had the kind of focus that Daring Fireball has always had,
and I had asked John about that early on, "Why don't you write about other things?". He's like "Well that's
because that's not what it is to me.". Well I'm like "Where's your outlet for those things?". And he's like
"Well, I just, that's what this is.". And, I'm, it's very clear when you look at Daring Fireball,
how successful that's become in large part because John is such a good writer,
and has such an interesting ability to analyze what's going on in that one specific space. But also,
I think because it always stayed on target, and if you look at what I had always done on Hivelogic, I mean sure,
there was those tutorials, but there was tonnes of other crap. Nobody knew what kind of crap they were going to
get fed that day. And that doesn't generally lead to a very, I mean, I think, the audience that was really there,
that really liked it, I mean, they were on board because they said "Oh I just like the stuff that Dan talks about in
general.". But, that's always going to be a much smaller subset, I think of people who are coming to expect
something, and you know you can pick on Daring Fireball as being that, you can, you know, there's a lot of
techn--I mean you're not going to go to Engadget and expect to read an article about, you know, buying a house or
something. It's going to be a very specific, targeted, focused kind of audience that goes there. And I think, I'm not
saying you should limit your focus on the things you're doing, but you should have a focus, and I think for me, I
never knew as an author, as a creator, you know, yeah I can just write about whatever I feel like and people will
read it and once in a while one of the posts will get linked and it will get a tonne of traffic. But, as the author,
I never felt like I knew what I should be doing, I never felt like I knew what I should be writing and doing, and
I'll tell you what, it's different to have a more--Today it's different to have something like a Twitter feed where
you can talk about whatever you want and people just like you because they like you, or hate you because they hate
you, but I think Twitter is a much easier way to fill that need.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>To do everything about yourself.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, and that way people are following you as a person, whereas when they think of a website or a blog,
it's not quite--to me it doesn't connect as well to say "I just read this blog because of this person",
that can be almost too much of a time commitment for people. So Twitter solves that problem.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah I mean it seems like in a way maybe part of what happened to all those blogs is that they--some of them
grew up and became quite professional, or quite focused, or quite well-written, or quite--like a Daring Fireball
or what you just described or other, you know like oh this is a real serious, you know polished blog,
which is kind of intimidating for many of the rest of us to say well how can I compete with that,
now that there are fifty really awesome blogs in this subject then how can my--why do I want to contribute my--and
then it also seems like there's so, so, so many, I don't want to use the word amateur, because it's not amateur,
it's just sort of more normal people writing blogs you know
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, mm hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It becomes intimidating to say well I don't know if I can write something because I don't know if I'll ever
have the audience because there's four million of these already.
</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah. Yeah, and I really do think there was a period of time where people just went to Hivelogic. I'm not
saying--I feel like I worked hard on it and the writing was good and everything else,
but I feel like there was a period of time where just having a blog at all qualified you to earn--you could earn
readers and a readership just simply because you where there, and this time period probably ended in the early
2000s, you know 2002 or 2003 maybe, by then if you just had a blog and you could write and you updated it a
couple times a week you would have an audience. And now, no way. But, the interesting thing that I find now,
and this feels like it's changed, and I know we're probably way off track now. But I feel like there was very
clearly back then, if somebody who had a very big blog, an A-list blog linked you,
and a couple other A-list blogs linked you, then you could become a B-list blog,
and maybe eventually an A-list blog. And now I don't think that's the case. I mean I know people who have a
written an article or done something where they've gotten just a tonne of attention,
tonnes and tonnes of traffic, you know, whether Daring Fireball linked them or they got Penny Arcade linked them,
or one of these big sites that's just got tonnes and tonnes of traffic and enthusiastic--but the thing is that
lasts for a few days and then it goes away, and the person is like, they really thought they were a really big
deal for a few days, and all of a sudden, maybe they're not that much of a big deal anymore,
and nobody is like coming back to their site. And I feel like that's how things kind of changed,
because now there are so many huge stories that everybody has to read today, and tomorrow there will be an equal
or greater number of "Oh man you must read this today, this is what's important" that those other things kind of get
lost in the shuffle, and there really isn't a good mechanism for people to say, I remember that site,
that was a neat thing, I want to go back to that. That does happen on Twitter. People will read a tweet that gets
retweeted a bunch of times, they'll see it, they'll think it's funny, they click the follow--done. Now they're
following that person. On the web, yeah I mean you have RSS feeds, but people are using RSS less and less and
less. And I know people who've never used RSS who are very smart and computer savvy,
and have no interest or desire to ever even use RSS, but they know how to follow somebody on Twitter and Facebook.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, I think Twitter really changed this dynamic, just completely, that we...it used to be that if you
wanted to keep up, and you wanted to know more, then you needed to remember to go back to a certain blog,
because where else would you go? I mean you weren't going to go to Friendster, you won't going to find that stuff
on MySpace, like, email listserve, that was the other place, so people would have a kind of community,
and a discussion, an ongoing discussion, in a space that you know wasn't one person's blog on listserve,
but Twitter provides this whole other way in which you can go to a site, it's really awesome,
you read the one article, you leave. You don't feel like you need to make that website sticky in your own life,
in your own brain.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right, right.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>You can...you'll just...if they write another awesome article, it'll show up on Twitter and you'll click it
then. And it feels like maybe if you click on articles from a certain one blog half a dozen times,
that's when you go "Ah, you know that's this person again" or that's this company again,
or that's this thing again. Let me put them in RSS if you're into that, or let me, you know follow them,
like if I see somebody I really like what that wrote, I'll just follow them on Twitter,
and assume that eventually it'll come back around. It's interesting--I mean it feels almost like--I don't know
what I would be doing without Twitter. I don't that I would have a career in a way,
like if I just really start thinking about the details of, "Well I met this person because I was at this event",
and I was at that event because I was following this other person on Twitter and they tweeted about it. On the
one hand that's kind of scary. One company--Email is not run by one company. Blogs are not run by one company.
Twitter, there's no other platform, there's no--you know--everything's on Twitter. Like if Twitter blew up,
or if Twitter sold itself to you know whatever crazy thing. There's no duplicate of it.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>But, I mean so is that the advice for the web designer, developer, business person? Like you really need to
be on Twitter, and you need to go follow, you need to go figure out industry leaders to follow,
and people in your slice of the world that are really good at what you do, and follow them.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Well I think so, don't you?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I don't think there's a better way to have direct--well not everybody follows this,
but I think generally speaking there isn't a better way to have direct contact with somebody,
especially in web and design and technology. That people make themselves so directly accessible to you with an
incredibly low barrier to get started, and such an immediate and direct way. Now the problem is,
when people start to get lots and lots and lots of followers, and every single tweet that they create gets dozens
or hundreds or more of replies. At that point it almost has to become--and there's just no way to get around
this--it almost just has to become a one-way kind of a communication, and it doesn't matter who it is. It doesn't
matter whether it's Lady Gaga, or Warren Ellis, or insert favorite person here. When they get more than--it seems
like there's a threshold, and the threshold is probably fifty thousand but maybe it's more than that. At that
point there's so many followers, and everything you tweet, there's just this barrage of @replies,
that you just can't--</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>You can't read them.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>You just really can't read them. So then you only want to pay attention to the few people that you follow,
and you know, you've got people who--and the other thing that's bad about it--or that you need to watch out for I
think--is just that there is so much--and you know this is always the case, we could do a whole show just on
this--but especially in little things like that, there's so much hostility out there--it's not the same kind of
hostility that you get like on a message board or with comments. I mean the most hostility is in comments. But,
you know, the fact still remains that Twitter is essentially an anonymous thing, and there's a lot of people who, for
whatever reason, you know they get angry--so you have to deal with that, I just don't want to paint this out as being
some amazing place as you go to Twitter and you follow Jeffrey Zeldman and all of a sudden you know, like you're
hanging out with him in the coffee shop in Manhattan. It may happen, it may not happen. But there's probably fewer
better ways to get in touch with somebody more directly than using something like Twitter.
</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Well--and I was--yesterday I needed a slideshow JavaScript library that I could implement very,
very quickly and I wanted it to work on touch devices, right. So right there you've--90% of the JavaScript
slideshow libraries out there don't have touch, they don't support touch events so they're done,
out. Found--asked on Twitter--I was looking and looking and searching, but really it's much faster to ask on
Twitter. Got a couple of great recommendations, checked them out. You know, was replying back to people who
had replied to me asking the original question, and both developers of the two libraries that I really liked
showed up. One of them first, and he was talking to me about it, and he's explaining why he thinks his is better than
the other one, and then I'm explaining to him about what's good about the other one. Not because I wanted to be a
jerk, but because I like them both, and I thought, hey you know, this guy's is better in this one way,
but if it was also better in these other three ways then it would be you know... and then the other guy showed up
and he's like "Hey, don't insult my..." like... And I found it remarkable because I was able very quickly to be
in conversation--not just with smart people who gave me advice about what library to use,
but the two people who made the two libraries that I was checking out.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right (laughs).</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And I could ask them questions. 'Cos I was like "Well, you know, does jQuery this version support this
thing?". Like I just asked them really quick on Twitter, without them hopefully being burdened too much. You
know, if people are asking me questions on Twitter, it's actually very quick to reply, it's not email, it's not,
you know comments on a blog, it's not writing a tutorial that you can take 5...what 30 seconds you can write a
tweet. But I just thought it was interesting, like wow, I'm talking to--remembering what it was like 5, 10 years
ago, as I was learning web everything, and you know I'm just imagining myself as this little nobody,
sitting in this little nobody office in a nobody town, and just being like "I don't know anything" and like "Oh
my god these two guys that made these libraries are talking to me!".</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, but you know I wish that there wasn't that kind of mentality out there,
of being "oh I'm a nobody person in a no place". You know everybody is or was at that point and it really doesn't
change, and I think there's this... Unless you're some kind of really huge superstar, and I'll go back to Lady Gaga
as a perfect example of this. Unless you're like internationally recognized and some kind of pop sensation,
everybody's pretty much at the same level, they really are, and that feeling that you describe which I think
everybody's had, or has at some level.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, usually most people still feel that way, even as they are the person that everyone else looks up to.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah. That sort of fear or insecurity or whatever you want to call it. That's the thing that I think gets in
the way.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Mmmhmm. Yeah I think it's about humanity and I think that even--you know I started out my first career in
theatre and worked in some theatres where some, you know extremely well-known celebrities would come and perform,
and also worked with a lot of actors who are not at all known, and realized really quickly that they're the same.
They're the same. Then some of the people who are not known are really full of themselves and very hard to work
with, and some of the people who are very famous were really full of themselves and hard to work with. And some
of the people who are famous and some of the people who are not famous were very gracious,
and very--they understood how to deal with the stress of the schedule of mounting a show and how to work with
everybody, even, you know, 16 year old kids who were working on the show, like, how to be a gracious person. And
there really wasn't any difference. And the celebrity thing is just all about--it's really a business tool to
getting better work and getting paid well, it's not a real thing.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>So speaking of getting paid well, aren't you supposed to be doing sponsors on this show?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Ah I'm supposed to do a sponsor! Yes</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Now they're going to be backed up right on top of each other.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>See, this is--I gotta figure out how to time things.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>How long of a show is this usually?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>How far? Half an hour in?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>An hour? Alright half an hour in.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So I'm 10 minutes late.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>We're going to have do both sponsors in the second half. Arggh.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Arggh. Sorry. Well let's start with the first one. Let's talk about Harvest.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>You want to do this?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yes let's do it. [00:32:54–00:37:00 Sponsor read for Harvest, GetHarvest.com/5by5]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So they were talking in the chat room a while back about how college professors let everybody down. Man,
I could just rant about college professors who teach web design and development. 'Cos I was a college professor
who taught web design and development and I saw what else was passing for web design and development. It's so sad.
'Cos this is what happens Dan. Professors go to college. People who end up becoming professors. They go to
college, they really love it. They don't want to go get a real job. So they say I'm going to go to graduate
school. So they go to graduate school and they get all these more years of degrees--which I also did at one point
later in my life--and then they become--they learn all this stuff, whatever it is. They learn history. They learn
English. They learn all about Shakespeare. And they become experts in that field. And then they go and they teach
it. And so most college professors, they basically learn everything that they need to know as a Shakespearian PHD
student, and then they spend the next 30, 40 years of their life teaching that stuff back to the world. And
somehow web design gets into that in the same way. Like "Oh I'm just going to go to graduate school and learn all
this stuff about, you know, Director, Shockwave Director, and then I'm going to become a college professor and I'm
just going to teach this class about Shockwave Director. I'll just teach the same class year after year after
year, 'cos that's what all the college professors do. You can't redo all your courses every semester--that's a
tonne of work." So you make a class, it's awesome and you teach it for the next 6 years. Same class,
exactly the same, same assignment, same homework, same reading, same for the next 6 years. So the graduate
classes that those professors took when they were students were old and out-of-date,
and then they go and teach them and it's old and out-of-date, and they've never worked as professional web
designers. They've never worked as professional web developers. They don't know much about the industry at all,
and they go and teach everyone to use Dreamweaver and table layouts and image slices.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>You're exactly right.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Shockwave Director.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah, you're right.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And just--gah I went to Temple, 2002, and they were using Shockwave, and I was like--</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Temple Owls!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Arghh, I couldn't, I was like ranting about Director, and right as I was leaving, in whenever that was,
2007 I think, they had all switched to Flash finally, and stopped teaching Director. And I'm like Flash is dead.
2008. I'm like, Flash is over. Like don't--(laughing)</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Well you were ahead of the thinking then in 2008 weren't you?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I was teaching video blogging in 2006.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Wow.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>The first ever university course in video blogging. 'Cos I was there to become better at what I was already
doing. I wasn't there to become a professional professor. And so I loved this stuff. I loved Blogger and blogging.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Now why do you think you were--and I mean this in a real way, I'm not -- why do you think you were so far ahead of the trend?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>I'm not the only one, there are plenty of people who do teach in university settings who keep up, who are good at this stuff, who want to be good at this stuff, and are good at it in the same way everyone else is, and learn in the same way that everybody else does. And I think I was one of those people. But sadly I think that it's more common, because of the culture of the academy itself, for people to just say "well I'm a multimedia professor, I teach multimedia arts" and then do what everybody else is doing. You know, I mean the film professors were teaching film-making out of the 70s--(laughing)</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>--they were not teaching--in fact they were quite--the film professors were quite against video. I mean they were just like "Video is awful. It's terrible. It will never replace film." This is in the mid-2000s. I'd love to see now. If I were teaching there now, I would get all the freshmen film-making 101 students to all shoot their beginning projects on the iPhone, because you know a lot of them would have it in their pocket and they don't have to take the time to checkout equipment.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>(laughing)</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Be like "OK, everybody who can shoot this assignment on your iPhone and then we're all going to go over to this professor and we're going to tell him you shot this on film, and we're going to have a throwdown! Let's have a contest to see if the professors can tell the difference between this brand new digital film." Especially, more than the iPhone, you know some of these film cameras are just gorgeous. The digital SLRs and the lenses that they have, you know, it's crazy how amazing the stuff is. And yet I bet you those film professors are still over there telling everybody, all the seniors, gosh those seniors would spend--they'd take out student loans and spend 5 to 10 thousand dollars on their senior projects so they could shoot them on film to impress the professors. And then carry that debt for you know 5, 10 years.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Ridiculous. When they could have been shooting it on video. Anyway, like I said, I could rant forever, but I think it does--I think it's starting to really hurt our profession that--it used to be that there were no classes because the web was new, and no-one in the academy knew anything about it. A lot of universities didn't even really have websites. And then now it's finally become something major. You can major in web design, web development. But the coursework is just, usually, not always, there are some really good programs out there, but, if you just pick a random program, a lot of them are just wrong, they're so bad, they're terrible. And so people are graduating and they're 25, and they got this debt and they want to go into the industry, and it's a great industry to go into because you can make some money to pay off that debt, and yet everything that they know is completely wrong.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Mmm. How depressing.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>And it's not their fault.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It's not their fault. In fact some of them are really sharp and smart. And there were some people in the chatroom further up--I don't know if I can see them, they were saying that err--iamel..--how do you say these people's names?</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I just go with--you're doing great</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Said the worst thing is if you do things the right way in classes like that, it's bad because then you don't pass, because to pass you have to code it in whatever antiquated way the professor wants.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Oh that's iamelliott.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>iamelliott</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah. Bad. When you know more than the teacher does.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I remember in one of my technical writing classes. Now see I've always been a writer. I grew up in a family where both my parents worked in college, my Mom is a college English professor. So I was reading and writing at a very early age, and always have done it. And of course my degree is in English, technical writing. I was doing a double major. Computer science and tech writing and the money was running out so I had to pick whichever one I was closer to and could afford to be done with and was further along with the writing so I graduated with that. But, the interesting thing, I had a professor who in one of these technical writing classes, they wanted things submitted along, I guess a path that most people would take. Now for me, writing's always been a bit of a different experience for me in that I typically just sit down and I write, and I don't do a lot of editing, I don't really do rough drafts. So if you're were to--I'm not recommending you do this--but if you were to go and read hivelogic or read some of my posts on alistapart, those are pretty good. That's my first draft typically. That's my one draft. I don't really do a rough draft and then go and edit it. I'm not saying it wouldn't be better if I did, but usually my first draft wasn't that bad. So a lot of the time I would just run with that. Well of course the way they want you to do this in college is the proper way, which is you start with notes, and then you do an outline from the notes, and then you refine the outline, and then you have your final outline, and then you begin with the rough draft, and then you--I never did any of that, I'd just sit down and start typing, and I would see it--I always felt like I was transcribing. I saw it all in my head. And then I could sit down and my hands had to go through this motion called typing and everything would just come out. And that's how I still write today. And typically it's already there, it's already formed, it's already written, I just have to go through this motion of communicating it on to the screen, and doing that--now I realise that's not typical, but that's just the way it works in my head. The teacher didn't grade you based on the final product.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Mmmmhmmm.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>He graded you based on all of these things. So the notes I would have--well I don't do notes, so my notes that I would turn in would be crap. Well I don't typically do much of an outline. So the outline I would turn in would be crap. And the rough draft would be barely better than the notes. It wouldn't match the outline. It'd be crap. Then this final thing I would turn in would be beautiful. Then it didn't matter because that's not what the grade was about. I mean obviously they were looking at that but each of these things were part of this bigger piece. It's like I didn't get that for the first half of the term. That he just wanted me to--and finally I said to my wife, well she wasn't my wife back then, she was my girlfriend back then. I said "You know I'm just going to do it the way he wants me to do it", and she's like, "Well yeah you probably should". And so I did it that way. And that's the only thing that saved my grade in the class is I said "Fine, you know what, I don't want to or need to do an outline but I'm going to do one". And people would say "Well didn't it help the process? Didn't it help you? Wasn't it better?" No. For me it was still a hindrance. It was extra work. And man, back then I was the most impatient person in the world. I couldn't stand that I had to--why did I have to do this extra work? I realised--back to your earlier point--that education in college, at its worst, all your doing is doing what the teacher wants you to do. It doesn't matter whether it's part of learning. It doesn't matter whether it's the right thing to do. (coughs) Excuse me. It doesn't matter whether it's something that you actually want to do. It's just--this is what the teacher has asked you to do so do that. And if you do that thing you will get the grade and then later when you get out of school you can do it the way you want to do it. And that was the hardest pill for me to swallow in college.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Well and I get it as a person who worked as a professor and needed to grade--you know I got 30 videos. They're all 4 minutes long and I'm supposed to give them grades and they're videos.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>(laughs)</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>(laughs) They're all you know dramatic whatever. They wrote a script and they got some friends to be actors and they shot it and they edited it together and they're all really bad (laughs)</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>They're all bad, all of it's bad because it's really hard to make a film and so the first several films you make are going to be bad. And sometimes you're like I don't know how to say this one's a C and this one's a B and this one's an A, you know I just make up some stuff, like you got 7 checkboxes, if you do each of those things then you get the A, if you do 5 you get a B, if you did 3 you get a--you know. I think some of this stuff is hard to teach. The creative things--like how do you--how are you a good--what's it take to be a good writer? Like sometimes it's a mystery. The thing that I think is really damaging is when you leave school with the impression that "well the proper way to do good writing is to make notes then an outline, then 5 paragraphs, and in each paragraph you have 5 sentences, and the first sentence (laughs)"--you know that sort of formula--like when you leave and you think that that's real and you think that that's the correct way to do things or even worse, you hate it, hate it, hate it, and so you leave saying "Well I'm a bad writer. I can't write. I'm not good at writing, because I didn't like that process". That's when it's really--so at least you left with a sense of this is jacked up, this is--</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Well if you get that concept though, that you're just doing what the teacher wants you to do because the teacher wants you to do it and you need to grade. That actually is pretty good preparation for the real world.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Mmhmm.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Because when your boss asks for something and you know--I think a lot of people, especially smart people, when they get out of school, the first thing they think is like "Oh wow I'm gonna have this cool new job" and they get to the job and they're doing stuff, they want to impress the boss and everything else. And pretty quickly they start to think, "you know (laughs), you know what I'm smarter than my boss. I know so much more than my boss. This boss--that boss doesn't know anything, that boss is stupid. I know so much more. I should be the boss because I know more." And eventually in like 10 years when you are the boss, you look back on that first boss and you're like "How did they know so much? What? They were so smart, I remember how they handled this thing. They knew everything." And you know--umm--someone in the chatroom said--I want to make sure I quote the right person. Transition says "Dan Benjamin says college sucks". I actually--I really don't think college sucks at all, and in fact I think--you know--there are people who always say "what am I doing in school? Should I even be in school?". I actually think that college is critical. I mean, so many of my friends didn't go to college or dropped out and they're huge successes, so obviously you don't need college to be successful. But I'll tell you what college does, I'll tell you what it does--or university as they say in the UK, "I'm at university". I think it's great and I think everybody if you can go to college you should try to go and you should try to finish if you can go. Because I think what it does, it teaches you some of these lessons that we're talking about, even though you learn the wrong thing. But what it also does is sort of sets that bar so that--I've never run a marathon--you've run a marathon right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>No (laughs).</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>I thought you ran a Boston marathon or something.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Oh Ironman I think. Once I accidentally ended up in an Ironman. (laughs). No.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Alright. Let's say you've run a Boston marathon. Let's say you've done that. When you meet somebody and it somehow comes up in conversation. They're like "Oh yeah. What year did you run the Boston marathon? Oh I ran it in 2004. Cool.". All of a sudden you guys both have this shared experience and the person now knows that when they think of you they think that yes, we had this shared common experience and you did it. You did this thing that I also did and that tells me something about you. Even though they may have completely incorrect notions about what it is that it tells them. And I think in many ways having a college degree--even if it's a degree that's not in the thing that you want to do--it says to a potential employer--and let's face it most people have employers for a lot of their career. It tells a potential employer "I did this thing and you know what this thing called going to college and graduating is and what it means. I did that." So that is at least I did that. So if I did that I can probably do this other thing that you want from me, that you want me to do. So I don't mean to downplay college, because if you go to a good school and you're like into it and the teachers are good and the curriculum is good and it can be an amazing and life-changing experience. But no matter what happens in there, at the very least you show up with that diploma and you're like "I got this thing and this proves to everybody who might want to give me some money which I need that I can at least do that."</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah and I agree with you, I mean I went to college and it was completely awesome and I majored in sociology and I feel like those classes and that training and that way of thinking about society. Thinking about the big picture, thinking about how this government policy or that cultural event can affect a whole society is something that I use everyday. I use that constantly as I design, because that's what you're doing as a designer. You're thinking about how the choices that you make are going to have an impact across a group of people. And statistical analysis, understanding you know how a good survey is written or not written, and while I've never written a sociological study I, you know, I can look at a survey, and be like "Yeah all those questions are really not good. You're going to get bad results out of that. You need to rewrite those questions." And that's not directly, you know, that's not directly--it's not trade school, I don't think you get a good web education in a sort of trade schooly way from many programs, but you can still get a really, really great education in general. Some of those liberal arts classes that everybody like "I don't want to take that class that's dumb, why would I ever need that information?". That's some of the best stuff. That general overall thinking is some of the most important I think long term.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>But back to--</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Critical thinking</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah critical thinking. But going back to keeping up with the industry. You know for people who are in school or not in school. It just seems like books, you know people talk about books, they talk about conferences, they talk about err--</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>People love the conferences.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And there are some good ones. It feels like books and conferences have stepped it up recently.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>2nd (fake coughs) sponsor.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>(laughs) And the 2nd sponsor--we'll talk about that in a moment.</dd>

<dt>Dan</dt>
<dd>Right after this break yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right after this way to pay the bill. Rackspace is our 2nd sponsor. [00:55:40–00:57:38 Sponsor read for Rackspace, Rackspace.com]</dd>
